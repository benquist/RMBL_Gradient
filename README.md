# RMBL_Gradient

Long-term gradient data for carbon fluxes, soil respiration, soil and air temperature, vegetation temperature and more plot related data. We assembled in 2003 annual measurements of ecosystem carbon flux data along an elevational gradient that ranged between 2460 and 3380 m above sea level and spanned a geographic distance of 39 km. The elevational gradient contains five long-term study sites that run from dry, shrub-dominated sage-brush-steppe (2475 m.a.s.l.) through the subalpine zone, to just below tree line (3380 m.a.s.l). These long-term study sites were established by Enquist in 2003 and have been sampled every year since. The gradient spans the Washington Gulch and East River valleys near RMBL, Crested Butte, and Almont, CO, USA. Each study site is approximately 50 m2 and is characterized by similar local slope, aspect, and vegetation  physiognomy. All sites consist of a mixture of shrubs, grasses, and forbs.

All sites consist of a mixture of shrubs, grasses, and forbs. There is substantial turnover of plant species between sites with very few of the 120 species sampled occurring in more than two of the sites (Bryant and others 2008). Additionally, shrub cover across the gradient decreases from a high of 33% at the lowest elevation site to 0% at the highest. A species list for each site is given by Bryant and others (2008). Every year, five 1.3 m 9 1.3 m plots were established haphazardly along the local slope of each study site, with at least five meters distance between plots.

We added several additional sites to the above gradient including Cinnemon, a higher elevation site, as well as three 
Department of Energy (DOE) sites where we are involved in a collaborative snow melt experiment.

Methodology 
Equipment and Measurements: Carbon Flux

Carbon flux was measured as instantaneous day- time peak uptake (ca. 10:00) and nighttime peak respiration (ca. 22:00) (see Saleska and others 1999 for diurnal measurements). Ambient CO2 was measured by a Li-Cor 7500 infra red gas analyzer for 30 s, and then the tent was put in place over the plot and the CO2 concentration within the tent was measured for 90 s (Jasoni and others 2005). Day- time measurements were only taken under cloud- less conditions. The tent was designed to let in 75% of photosynthetically active radiation (tent fabric by Shelter Systems). Air inside the tent was well mixed by fans, and the tent chamber was sealed using a long, canvas skirt along the base of the tent that was covered with a heavy chain. The volume of the tent used along the gradient was 2.197 m3, whereas a smaller tent of volume 0.125 m3 was used in the watering experiment. Although the tent flux method (described by Jasoni and others 2005) does not offer the same spatial coverage as continuous flux measurements such as eddy flux towers, the portable design does allow the ability to rapidly assess carbon flux at a wider variety of locations within and across experimentally manipulated and control plots (Arnone and Obrist 2003).
