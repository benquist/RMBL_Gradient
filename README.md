# RMBL_Gradient

Long-term gradient data for carbon fluxes, soil respiration, soil and air temperature, vegetation temperature and more plot 
related data. We assembled in 2003 annual measurements of ecosystem carbon flux data along an elevational gradient that 
ranged between 2460 and 3380 m above sea level and spanned a geographic distance of 39 km. The elevational gradient contains 
five long-term study sites that run from dry, shrub-dominated sage- brush-steppe (2475 m.a.s.l.) through the subalpine zone, 
to just below tree line (3380 m.a.s.l) (Ta- ble 1). These long-term study sites were established by Enquist in 2003 and have 
been sampled every year since. The gradient spans the Washington Gulch and East River valleys near RMBL, Crested Butte, and 
Almont, CO, USA. Each study site is approximately 50 m2 and is characterized by simi- lar local slope, aspect, and vegetation 
physiogno- my. All sites consist of a mixture of shrubs, grasses, and forbs.

We added several additional sites to the above gradient including Cinnemon, a higher elevation site, as well as three 
Department of Energy (DOE) sites where we are involved in a collaborative snow melt experiment.
